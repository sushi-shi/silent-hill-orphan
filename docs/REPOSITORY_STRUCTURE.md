# Repository structure — Silent Hill: Orphan

This repository is **resource-free** and dedicated to the public domain (CC0).
It contains only recovered-by-hand reconstruction and our own code — never
literal copied binaries. See the j2me home's `PLAYBOOK.md` for the method.

## Resource storage contract (three layers)

1. **Authored sources, in this repo** — engine/game/tooling code, transcribed
   data, and the reconstruction ledgers (`java/reconstruction/`).
2. **Binary resources, in a private resources location** — the surviving
   distributions. `tools/originals/fetch.py <path-or-url>` (or the env var named
   in `game.toml`) copies them into git-ignored `_originals/` and runs
   `verify.py`. The location is never baked into the repo (R1).
3. **Derived, regenerable** — `_reference/` (catalogs, fingerprints, decompiles)
   and web outputs, rebuilt from layers 1–2, never committed.

## Boundary rules (fill in as phases land)

- The root `Cargo.toml` is the only workspace manifest; one `target/`, one lock.
- `transliteration/` (Phase 3) is an executable spec, not the shipped engine —
  production code must not depend on it at runtime; tests may (R12).
- `crates/` holds the shipped engine libraries (2D or 3D per `game.toml`'s
  `fork`); `apps/` the frontends; `web/` page composition only.
- Repository-owned ignored directories begin with `_`; `.gitignore` matches them
  by name (no trailing-slash globs) so symlinks are covered too (R2).
- `_originals` must be a **real directory, never a symlink** (R2).

## Planned layout (mirrors the sibling ports)

```text
